# SanctusGame

The football game we prepared for the Advanced Game course.
We used Unity and C# while preparing our game, and Jira technologies in the project management part.

As the Sanctus game team, we were 4 people.

*Aslı Türkoğlu (developer, scrum master)
*Kamil Çoban (developer)
*Agah Berkin Güler (developer)
*Abdulkerim Çan (developer)

(The commits do not fully reflect the participation of the group members. 
There were times when everyone had shared coding sessions and everyone contributed, and then only one person committed.)
